title: Hello World!

In this blog, I will be posting some of my "Ah ha" moments while working on various freelance projects as a RoR developer.  Thank you for stopping by.  Since this is the first post, I'll tell you a little bit about myself. 

I graduated from the University of Georgia with a bachelor degree of Environmental Health. Decided to have a career change since the environmental thing is not really working out for me. Hello Ruby on Rails.  Thanks to the people at [Bibles for America](https://www.bfa.org), I landed a junior developer job with little to no experience (talk about learning on the job!). I have been with them since 2014.

### A few of the projects that I worked and collaborated on:

* [biblechallenges.com](http://www.biblechallenges.com/). A Bible reading tool that sends you chapters daily via email. Caters to a group.
* [openmanna.com](https://www.openmanna.com/). A subscription service that sends you Bible verses via SMS according to your customized schedule.  
* [conferenceregistration.com](http://college.seconferenceregistration.com/). This is a web app that allows neighboring churches to create a conference and manage signups.  This app uses `Acts as Tenant` Gem that allows multi-tenancy through a shared database strategy. More on this with future posts.

This blog is also my attempt to play around with jekyll, which I am starting to like a lot.
